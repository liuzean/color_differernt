The error message:

```
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
```

means that your local branch and the remote branch have diverged (both have unique commits), so a simple fast-forward merge is not possible. You need to perform a merge or rebase to integrate the changes.

The most common and safe way is to run:

```sh
git pull --rebase origin main
```

This will rebase your local commits on top of the latest remote commits, keeping the history linear and avoiding a merge commit.

If you prefer a merge (which will create a merge commit), you can use:

```sh
git pull origin main
```

Would you like to proceed with the rebase (recommended for most workflows), or do you prefer a merge? If you want, I can propose the rebase command for you to run directly.
