Implement the CMYK Calibration method. You need to create sample by yourself and test them. @/color

Guide:

Step 1: Create a CMYK Target Chart You need a digital file with a grid of color patches defined by CMYK values. This will be your "ideal" chart. It should include:

Patches for 100% Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black.
Gradations of each ink (e.g., 10%, 20%, ... 90%).
Overprints (e.g., 100% C + 100% M, 100% C + 100% Y, etc.).
Various combinations of C, M, Y, and K to sample the printer's gamut.
A range of grays using only K ink and composite grays using C, M, and Y.
Step 2: Print and Measure

Print the Chart: Print your digital CMYK target chart on the printer you want to calibrate, using the specific paper and print settings you intend to use. It is crucial to disable any automatic color management in the printer driver during this step.
Measure the Patches: This is the most critical and difficult part without specialized hardware. You need a spectrophotometer to measure the printed patches. This device measures the actual color of each patch and gives you its value in a device-independent space, almost always CIE Lab.
Step 3: Extend the Software Pipeline Your goal is to build a mapping from the desired color (Lab) to the ink percentages (CMYK) that produce it.

Represent CMYK:

Create a CMYKColorSpace class in the software.
It won't have primaries and a gamma curve like RGB spaces. Instead, its core data will be the lookup table you are about to build.
Ingest Measurement Data:

Your software will need to read two pieces of data:
The "ideal" CMYK values from your digital target file.
The measured Lab values from the spectrophotometer for each corresponding patch.
Build the Transformation (The "Calibration")

You now have a set of (CMYK_input -> Lab_output) pairs. You need to invert this to create a (Lab_input -> CMYK_output) transformation.
This is not a simple 3x3 matrix like the CCM. It's a complex, multi-dimensional lookup table (LUT). You would need to implement an interpolation algorithm (like trilinear or tetrahedral interpolation) to find the correct CMYK value for a Lab color that wasn't directly measured.
This resulting LUT is the core of an ICC profile. You could either build your own system for this or use a library designed for creating ICC profiles.
Summary of Pipeline Extension:

Input: A list of CMYK values and their corresponding measured Lab values.
Process: Build a multi-dimensional lookup table (LUT) that maps Lab values to CMYK values, using interpolation for colors that fall between your measured points.
Output: A custom color profile (e.g., an ICC file) that can be used to convert any image from a standard color space (like sRGB or Adobe RGB) to the specific CMYK space of your printer/paper combination.
