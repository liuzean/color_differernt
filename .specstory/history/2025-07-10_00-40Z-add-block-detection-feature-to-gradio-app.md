# Add block_detection feature to Gradio app (2025-07-10 00:40Z)

_**User**_

Add color bar detection feature into my gradio app with a new tab,

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add a color bar detection feature into their gradio app with a new tab. First, I need to understand their existing app structure and then see how the color bar detection works.

From the project layout, I can see they have:
1. An `app.py` file in the root
2. A `core/block_detection/yolo_show.py` file that contains YOLO-based color bar detection logic
3. An `interface/` directory with GUI components

Let me first look at the existing app.py to understand the current structure, then examine the color bar detection code that's already implemented.</details></think>

I'll help you add a color bar detection feature to your gradio app. Let me first examine your existing app structure and the color bar detection code.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the app structure. The main gradio interface is created in `interface/gui.py`. Let me examine that file to understand how tabs are currently structured, and then look at the color bar detection code more closely.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I can see how the gradio interface is structured. The main function is `create_interface()` and it has multiple tabs. I can also see how the YOLO color bar detection works in the `yolo_show.py` file. 

Let me examine the YOLO detection code more closely to understand what inputs and outputs it needs, and then look at the main interface structure to see where to add the new tab.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a good understanding of how both the gradio interface and the YOLO color bar detection work. Let me create a comprehensive plan to add the color bar detection feature to the gradio app:

1. I need to create a new tab for color bar detection
2. The YOLO detection functionality needs to be adapted for gradio - converting from a CLI-based tool to a web interface
3. I need to add the necessary imports and model loading logic
4. The interface should allow users to upload an image and get color bar detection results

Let me look at the end of the gui.py file to see where the interface definition ends and where I should add the new tab.</details></think>

</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I have all the information I need. I can see that:

1. The model weights are located at `core/block_detection/weights/best0710.pt` (not `best.pt` as in the yolo_show.py)
2. The interface structure is clear - I need to add a new tab to the main Gradio interface
3. I need to create a new function to handle the YOLO color bar detection that's compatible with Gradio

Let me now create the color bar detection tab. I'll need to:

1. Add the necessary imports for YOLO
2. Create a function to process images with YOLO detection
3. Add a new tab to the interface
4. Create the UI components for the color bar detection

I'll add the new tab right after the existing tabs but before the settings section.</details></think>

---

Now I'll add the color bar detection feature to your gradio app. I'll need to:

1. Create a new color bar detection function that works with gradio
2. Add a new tab for color bar detection
3. Integrate the YOLO model loading and processing

Let me create this step by step:

## ‚úÖ Successfully Added Color Bar Detection Feature

I've successfully integrated the YOLO-based color bar detection functionality into your gradio app with a new dedicated tab. Here's what has been implemented:

### üîß **Key Features Added:**

1. **üéØ New Color Bar Detection Tab** - A dedicated interface for color bar detection
2. **ü§ñ YOLO Model Integration** - Uses your existing trained model (`best0710.pt`)
3. **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Settings** - Adjustable confidence threshold and box expansion
4. **üìä Visual Results** - Shows detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores
5. **üé® Color Bar Extraction** - Automatically extracts detected color bars as separate images
6. **üì∑ Live Preview** - Shows uploaded image preview before processing

### üé® **User Interface:**

The new tab includes:
- **File upload** for input images
- **Detection settings** (confidence threshold, box expansion, extraction toggle)
- **Results display** showing annotated image with detection boxes
- **Gallery view** of extracted color bars
- **Information panel** with detection statistics

### üîß **Technical Implementation:**

- **Model Loading**: Automatic YOLO model loading with error handling
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV-based image processing with RGB conversion for gradio
- **Detection Logic**: Confidence filtering, box expansion, and annotation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for missing models or invalid images

### üìã **Usage Instructions:**

1. **Start the app**: `python app.py`
2. **Navigate to**: "üéØ Color Bar Detection" tab
3. **Upload image**: Click "üìÅ Input Image" and select your image
4. **Adjust settings**: Modify confidence threshold (default: 0.5) and box expansion (default: 10px)
5. **Detect**: Click "üîç Detect Color Bars" button
6. **View results**: See annotated image and extracted color bars

### üì¶ **Dependencies Updated:**

- Added `ultralytics>=8.0.0` to `requirements.txt` for YOLO functionality

### üîó **Integration Points:**

The feature seamlessly integrates with your existing app structure:
- Uses the same gradio theme and styling
- Follows the same error handling patterns
- Maintains the same code organization

Your color bar detection feature is now ready to use! The app should be accessible at `http://localhost:7861` with the new tab available alongside your existing color difference analysis tools.
