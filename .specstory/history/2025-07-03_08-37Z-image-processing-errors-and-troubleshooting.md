<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at this error, I can see several issues:

1. There's an alignment error: `'tuple' object has no attribute 'queryIdx'` - This suggests that the SIFT feature matching is returning tuples instead of DMatch objects.

2. There's a mismatch in the number of return values from the `process_images_handler` function - it needs to return 18 values but only returned 15.

3. There are issues with image masking where NoneType is being passed instead of valid images.

Let me start by examining the relevant files to understand the structure and then fix these issues.

I'll need to look at:
1. The GUI interface to understand the expected return values
2. The image alignment code to fix the queryIdx error
3. The masking code to fix the NoneType errors

Let me start by examining the GUI file and then the alignment code.</details></think>

I can see several issues in your code based on the error logs:

1. **Image alignment error**: `'tuple' object has no attribute 'queryIdx'` - This suggests the SIFT matching is returning tuples instead of DMatch objects
2. **Return value mismatch**: The function needs to return 18 values but only returned 15
3. **Image masking error**: NoneType is being passed to masking functions

Let me examine the relevant files to fix these issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me read the process_images_handler function to understand the expected return values.</details></think>

---

Read file: interface/gui.py

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue clearly. The `process_images_handler` function expects to return 18 values, but when there's an error, it only returns 15 values. Let me also examine the `compute_homography` method in the alignment file to fix the "queryIdx" error.</details></think>

---

Read file: core/image/alignment.py

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue! In the `compute_homography` method, the code is trying to access `m.queryIdx` and `m.trainIdx` on the matches, but the matches might be tuples instead of proper DMatch objects.

Let me also check the process_images function to see how it's handling errors and what it's supposed to return.

The error messages show:
1. "图像对齐失败: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'queryIdx'" - This means matches are tuples instead of DMatch objects
2. The function returns only 15 values instead of 18 required

Let me look at the process_images function first.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to see the rest of the process_images function to understand what it returns. Let me continue reading it.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me check the feature matcher to understand why the matches are tuples instead of DMatch objects.</details></think>

---

Read file: core/image/features/matcher.py

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I see the issue! The problem is in the `compute_homography` method in the alignment file. When it tries to access `m.queryIdx` and `m.trainIdx`, it seems the matches are coming as tuples rather than proper DMatch objects. This happens when the matching code returns tuples instead of DMatch objects.

Let me now fix the issues:

1. Fix the match handling in the compute_homography method to handle both DMatch objects and tuples
2. Fix the return value count in process_images_handler to return exactly 18 values
3. Fix the masking NoneType issue

Let me start by fixing the alignment code first.</details></think>

I've identified the issues in your code. Let me fix them:

1. **The `queryIdx` error**: The matches are coming as tuples instead of DMatch objects
2. **Return value mismatch**: The function needs to return 18 values but only returns 15
3. **Masking NoneType error**: Need to handle None values properly

Let me fix these issues:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to fix the compute_alignment_score method to handle tuples as well:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to fix the masking issue by adding proper error handling for None values:</details></think>

Now I need to fix the main issue with the return value count in the process_images_handler. The function needs to return exactly 18 values but is currently returning only 15. Let me check what the expected outputs are and fix this:</details></think>

```diff
                                   output_dir, save_intermediate, block_size_h=32, block_size_w=32, use_mask=True):

              # 获取文件路径

              if not template_path or not target_path:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>



Now I need to make sure the background removal in the main process_images function handles None values properly. Let me check if the alignment result is None before trying to remove the background:</details></think>

---

```diff
              logger.info("移除背景")
              try:
+                 # 只有在对齐成功且图像不为None时才移除背景
+                 if result.success and result.aligned_image is not None:
                      result.aligned_image = MaskingProcessor.remove_background(result.aligned_image, alpha_mask)
+                 if result.success and result.roi_aligned is not None:
                      result.roi_aligned = MaskingProcessor.remove_background(result.roi_aligned, alpha_mask)
                  logger.info("背景移除成功")
```

Perfect! Now let me run the application to test if the fixes work. The main issues I've fixed are:

1. **Fixed the queryIdx error**: Updated `compute_homography` and `compute_alignment_score` methods to handle both DMatch objects and tuples
2. **Fixed the return value count**: Made sure all return statements in `process_images_handler` return exactly 18 values
3. **Fixed the masking NoneType error**: Added proper None checks in the `remove_background` method and improved background removal logic to only process valid images

Let me test these fixes by running the application.</details></think>
