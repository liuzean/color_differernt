你什么成分，敢跟我整天reject？

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has sent a message in Chinese that roughly translates to "What are you made of, daring to reject me all day?" This appears to be a confrontational question or possibly a joke, and it's not related to the coding project we've been working on.

I should respond politely in English as specified in the user rules, and focus on being helpful with the actual coding project. I'll clarify that I'm here to assist with their coding tasks and ask if they have any specific questions about the color-difference project we've been working on.</details></think>

I'm here to help with your code for the color-difference project. According to your rules, I should respond in English. Do you have any questions about the code or need help with specific features in your project?
